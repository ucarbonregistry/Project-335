# Project-335
30 MW Biomass based power supply to grid at Mankapur, Uttar Pradesh

The project activity involves two power generating stations within the same premises- one is a 36.9
MW biomass fuelled cogeneration system, wherein the surplus electricity is exported to the grid and
another is a distillery based power generation unit supplying 5 MW electricity to the grid. The project
is developed by Balrampur Chini Mills Limited. Location of the project activity is in Village Datauli,
Tehsil Mankapur, District Gonda, State Uttar Pradesh, and Country India.


The details of the registered project are as follows:

Purpose of the project activity:

Mankapur Chini Mills is a unit of Balrampur Chini Mills Limited, located in Datauli village of Gonda
district, Uttar Pradesh. Project activity involves installation of three biomass fired boilers in the plant
premises. Two of these are 100 TPH in capacity and one of it has 45 TPH capacity. All the boilers use
bagasse and other surplus process waste biomass and residues as fuel. The 45 TPH boiler is connected
to a 6.6 MW extraction cum condensing turbine; while both the 100 TPH boilers are connected with
a common steam header and supply steam to one extraction cum condensing turbine of capacity 22
MW and two back pressure turbines of capacities 11.9 MW and 3 MW each. The cogeneration facility
generates steam for both process needs and meeting captive electricity requirements of the plant. After
meeting the in-house demand of electricity, surplus electricity is exported to the grid. The state
discom, Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) has signed a PPA for 25 MW with the
sugar division of the plant and a separate agreement for 5 MW with the distillery based power division
to supply surplus electricity to grid. Hence, the purpose of the project activity is to supply renewable
electricity to the grid and increase the percentage of renewable energy in Indian grid mix.
In absence of the project activity, equivalent amount of electricity which is supplied by this project
activity would have been supplied to the grid by fossil fuel dominated power plant(s) connected to
this grid. The commissioning date of the project is 20/09/2006 while the first PPA was signed on
20/04/2007. Hence, as per UCR guideline, start date of the crediting period would be considered from
01/01/2013, as the commissioning date is after 2002 and prior to 2013.
Thus, the project activity would provide electricity from carbon-neutral sources, which would have
otherwise been supplied by fossil fuel dominated power plants connected to the grid. Biomass is a
renewable source of energy and also considered as carbon neutral. In the project activity the preferred
fuels are bagasse and other process waste biomass residues.
